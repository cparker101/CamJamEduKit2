# CamJamEduKit2
The CamJam EduKit 2 -- Sensors is the second kit in the CamJam EduKit series.  In this version you will be using the RPi.GPIO Python 3 Library to interact with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

Two specific sensors will be discussed:

1.  A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) - a resistor whose resistance changes depending on how much light is falling on its serface.
2.  The Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) - that detects movement near it.  PIRs are commonly used in burglar alars, lights that come on when people approach, and som CCTV cameras.
